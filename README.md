# green-admin
An example app, that also does administration. What's this sorcery?

It provides at least some insight into what's running in the green system, in terms of nodes and apps (and their actors). It can terminate a node, so you should prolly not have this hang around in public :-)

## Future

Nobody can foresee the future. But I imagine this app will receive a UI and become dockerified.
